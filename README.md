- 👋 Hi, I’m @cAInnonwantstolearnmore
- 👀 I’m interested in upgrading my coding skills, sharing my Prompting skills, and fine-tuning myself (and my bots) to reach my full potential.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Python, and everything I can about AI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate to create fine-tuned models that benefit/change society.
- 📫 How to reach me, well, it's 2024, feel like anyone should be able to figure it out. That said, email: cannon@yourcaio4now.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/doctor
- ⚡ Fun fact: Excluding the intro orchestra instrumental intro, I can play the entire epic show known as "The Last Waltz".
